# Tentacle Solutions

## Overview and Origin

Founded in 2015 and launched in 2016, VeChain was introduced to the world by its founder Sunny Lu as a blockchain traceability solution for the luxury fashion industry. The concept for VeChain manifested as a result of its founder's knowledge of blockchain technology with his years of experience in supply chain management as CIO of Louis Vuitton China. VeChain was originally a token on the Ethereum blockchain, however in 2018 they made the transition onto their own blockchain and rebranded themselves to VeChainThor. VEN was converted to 100 VET, which caused a substantial price drop when compared to the USD from $8.26 per VEN in the start of 2018 to less than 1/2 of $0.01 per VET by the end of 2018. They have since expanded their efforts far beyond the luxury fashion industry, spreading their tentacles across virtually every concievable industry with their "Blockchain-as-a-Service" platform called "ToolChain". It offers a variety of services that allow businesses of all sizes utilize blockchain technology in their business. VeChain offers solutions for industries such as Carbon Reduction, Logistics, Natural gas, and even Agriculture amongst many others.

## Business Activities

Framed in the companys White Paper is an example of one of the many solutions VeChain can offer to real world problems. The problem is that food fraud costs the global food industry an estimated $40 billion each year, and one in 10 people in the world will become ill from eating contaminated food. The traceability offered by VeChain can provide users with instantly accessible, trustworthly, and accurate records of a products history, authenticity, and data of any kind. Not only would this improve the user experience, it would save industries billions in supply chain losses, recalls, fraudulent goods, manufacturing errors, and transportation errors. Currently, VeChain has patnered with over 200 companys and hopes to increase that number to 1000 by the end of 2020. These partnerships include big fish such as Walmart China, Shanghai Gas, H&M, BMW Group, and LVMH.

## Landscape

VeChain considers itself a non-profit organization, and currently has no real viable competitors likely because the wide array of services they provide means any competition is only competetive on one of Vechains many "tentacles". With an already established and growing set of users, VeChain is doing their best to position themselves in the market well enough to play a significant roll in the adoption of blockchain technology. The team behind VeChain is so dedicated to its long term growth that they even locked up their own holdings as a testament. As blockchain begins to become standard in many industries, supply chain management is going to be an important role just as it always have been. VeChain aims to be on the forefront of the advancements neccessary.

## Results

VeChains value as a company lies congruent with how much value its users entrust it with. With widespread adoption so close, yet so far, VeChain is poised to solidify its position as a dominant player, and demonstrate its value over time. The greatest burden this company will bear is the need to educate consumers and manufacturers on what massive advantages blockchain will bring to the table as far as business. Without educating the masses, adoption in business will only remain slowed.

## Recommendations

When trying to make recommendations, the lack of specificity in VeChains area of expertise becomes a serious impediment. My first thought is how VeChain could be used to track COVID-19 test results, however I quickly found out that they are already working on infiltrating that domain. The only genuine critique i could muster up was that the VeChainThor blockchain is closed source, so people may have a hard time trusting it right away. This will be less of an issue if they continue to establish a reputation. Privacy, I believe, will be a big concern for VeChains future users because making infomation public such as the location of a large shipment of high value items, would put the security of those items at risk of theft of destruction. or for instance, if the government decides to adopt the use of VeChain for military supplies then they dont want the public to know where, when, and how many military grade items will be in shipment "ABC". At the very Least i would urge them to put more money into marketing, and address the efforts they are making towards security to make people feel more comfortable. Having ownership of ones data could get messy in the courtroom, so perhaps regtech will have a solution to that inevitable hurdle soon.
